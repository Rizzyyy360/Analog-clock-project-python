# HELLO!! WELCOME TO MY ANALOG CLOCK PROJECT 🕰️

It's something I'd been wanting to do for so long and finally, here it is!  
Let me take you on a little story about it...

## ✨ My Journey

My first attempt at making a clock was 5 years ago, back when I was in 10th standard. It was a complete failure—circle geometry was a mystery to me, and I just didn't have the right knowledge. I learned Python, but then life happened and I stopped... until now!  
Recently, I’ve started to get my hands dirty in the realm of programming again, and this clock is my comeback project.

## ⚙️ About the Project

This is a basic Python piece of code that uses the **turtle**, **datetime**, and **math** modules.  
At first, I was kinda struggling, not gonna lie—so I followed a basic video game dev tutorial on turtle (shoutout to [freeCodeCamp.org's Learn Python by Building 5 Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w) on YouTube!). It didn’t solve all my problems, but it gave me the kickstart I needed.

The real struggle? THE MATH.  
Figuring out and managing every single angle for the hands to match the time took most of my time (pun intended).  
And yes, I did consult AI for some doubts—like how to draw big dots around the border at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 positions without the hands getting overlapped.  
But, fun fact: when I pasted my code into ChatGPT to "refine" it, it just made a mess and introduced a bunch of bugs! So, AI is cool and all, but sometimes you just gotta do it yourself.  
AI will get better, but right now, it's a tool—not a replacement for your own struggle and learning! 😉

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. **Clone or download this repo.**
2. **Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.**
3. Turtle usually comes with Python, but if not, you can install it with:
    ```bash
    pip install PythonTurtle
    ```
4. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python analog_clock.py
    ```

## 🕹️ Features

- Real-time analog clock drawing (it ticks!).
- Cool dots highlighting 3, 6, 9, and 12.
- Uses turtle graphics—so it's all drawn in real time.
- The code is beginner-friendly, but may have some “garbage” (unused variables, long code blocks that could definitely be shorter... you know how it is 😅).
